# shopping-list

A small application to create shopping lists to be viewed and edited by multiple people.

### To-Do List
- Make a PWA (register service-worker)
- Add socket.io to handle client-server interactions
- (Probably) Remove semantic-ui if it's not really helping much and just make some responsive styles manually
- Hook up to Firebase to store the information in the no-sql db (in case a node server crashes we don't want the data to be lost)

### Running locally
``` 
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
